### OBJECTIVE
Extract ALL safety decision points from this clinical trial protocol PDF.

This extraction covers SAFETY DECISION POINTS only:
- Dose modification rules and criteria
- Study/subject stopping rules
- Organ-specific dose adjustments (hepatic, renal, cardiac, etc.)
- Safety parameter monitoring thresholds
- Dose levels and re-escalation criteria

### CRITICAL: VALUES ONLY
Extract VALUES ONLY. Do NOT include any provenance fields (section_number, page_number, text_snippet).
Provenance will be added in a separate extraction step.

### OUTPUT STRUCTURE
Return JSON matching this structure. Do NOT include provenance objects anywhere.

```json
{
  "id": "PROTOCOL_ID-safety-decision-points",
  "instanceType": "SafetyDecisionPoints",
  "name": "PROTOCOL_ID Safety Decision Points",

  "discovered_categories": [],
  "decision_points": [],
  "stopping_rules_summary": {},
  "dose_modification_levels": {},
  "organ_specific_adjustments": [],

## DISCOVERED CATEGORIES STRUCTURE
---

Categories represent groups of safety parameters found in the protocol:

```json
{
  "category_id": "cat-001",
  "category_name": "Hematologic Toxicity",
  "category_description": "Blood cell count and coagulation parameters",
  "parameters_count": 5
}
```

Common categories:
- Hematologic Toxicity (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia)
- Hepatic Toxicity (AST, ALT, bilirubin elevations)
- Renal Toxicity (creatinine, GFR changes)
- Cardiac Toxicity (QTc prolongation, LVEF changes)
- Dermatologic Toxicity (rash, skin reactions)
- Gastrointestinal Toxicity (nausea, diarrhea)
- Neurologic Toxicity (neuropathy, seizures)
- Pulmonary Toxicity (pneumonitis, dyspnea)

---
## DECISION POINTS STRUCTURE
---

Each decision point captures a safety parameter with its rules:

```json
{

  "parameter_name": "Neutrophil Count",
  "parameter_category": "Hematologic Toxicity",
  "measurement_type": "ANC (cells/μL)",
  "decision_rules": [
    {
      "rule_id": "dp-001-r1",
      "rule_type": "dose_hold",
      "rule_description": "Hold treatment for Grade 3-4 neutropenia",
      "conditions": {
        "grade": ">=3",
        "anc_threshold": "<1000",
        "duration": null
      },
      "actions": [
        {
          "action_type": "hold_dose",
          "action_description": "Hold study drug until ANC ≥1500/μL"
        }
      ],
      "recovery_criteria": {
        "anc_required": ">=1500",
        "timeframe": "within 14 days"
      }
    }
  ],
  "monitoring_requirements": {
    "frequency": "Weekly during first 2 cycles",
    "method": "Complete blood count"
  }
}
```

### RULE TYPES
| rule_type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| dose_hold | Temporarily hold treatment |
| dose_reduce | Reduce dose level |
| dose_discontinue | Permanently stop treatment |
| supportive_care | Add supportive medication |
| monitoring_increase | Increase monitoring frequency |

      "description": "Recurrent Grade 4 toxicity despite dose reduction",
      "trigger_threshold": "Second occurrence of Grade 4 toxicity",
      "action": "Permanent discontinuation from study drug"
    },
    {
