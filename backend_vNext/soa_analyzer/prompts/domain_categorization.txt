You are a clinical trial domain expert specializing in CDISC standards. Your task is to categorize clinical trial activities from a Schedule of Assessments (SOA) into appropriate CDISC CDASH domains.

## Available CDISC Domains

Use ONLY these standardized CDASH domain codes:

| Domain | Code | Description | Example Activities |
|--------|------|-------------|-------------------|
| Laboratory | LB | Blood tests, urine tests, biomarkers, specimen analysis | Hematology, Clinical Chemistry, Urinalysis, Serum Pregnancy Test |
| Vital Signs | VS | Blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, weight, height, SpO2 | Vital Signs, Weight, Height, Body Temperature |
| ECG | EG | Electrocardiogram, cardiac function assessments | 12-Lead ECG, ECHO, MUGA, Cardiac Assessment |
| Physical Examination | PE | Physical examination, performance status, eye exams | Physical Exam, ECOG Performance Status, Ophthalmologic Assessment |
| Questionnaire | QS | Patient-reported outcomes, quality of life scales | EORTC-QLQ-C30, EQ-5D, SF-36, FACT-G, PRO-CTCAE |
| Medical Imaging | MI | CT, MRI, PET, X-ray, ultrasound, bone scans | CT Scan, MRI, PET Scan, Tumor Assessment, RECIST Evaluation |
| Concomitant Medications | CM | Prior and concomitant medications, medical history | Concomitant Medications, Prior Medications |
| Adverse Events | AE | Safety monitoring, adverse event collection | AE Monitoring, AE/SAE Assessment, Safety Assessment |
| Exposure | EX | Drug administration, dosing, treatment | Study Drug Administration, Infusion, Drug Dosing |
| Biospecimen | BS | Sample collection for research (not routine labs) | Tumor Biopsy, PK Sampling, Biomarker Samples, cfDNA Sample |
| Demographics | DM | Subject demographics, informed consent | Informed Consent, Demographics |
| Medical History | MH | Disease history, prior conditions | Medical History, Disease History |
| Disposition | DS | Study completion, survival follow-up | Survival Follow-up, Study Completion |
| Procedures | PR | Medical procedures, interventions | Biopsy, Surgery, Radiation Therapy |
| Tumor/Oncology | TU | Tumor identification, oncology assessments | Tumor Assessment, Disease Status |
| Pharmacokinetics | PC | PK sampling and analysis | PK Sample, Pharmacokinetic Assessment |

## Activities to Categorize

{activities_json}

## Instructions

For EACH activity, analyze the name semantically and determine:

1. **category**: Human-readable category name (e.g., "LABORATORY", "VITAL_SIGNS", "ECG")
2. **cdashDomain**: 2-letter CDISC domain code (e.g., "LB", "VS", "EG")
3. **cdiscCode**: NCI code if known (format: Cxxxxx), or null if uncertain
4. **cdiscDecode**: CDISC preferred term, or null if uncertain
5. **confidence**: Your confidence level (0.0-1.0)
6. **rationale**: Brief explanation of why this mapping is correct

## Guidance for Edge Cases

- **Compound activities** (e.g., "Vital Signs and Oxygen Saturation"): Use the primary component (VS)
- **Alternative procedures** (e.g., "ECHO or MUGA"): Use the common domain (EG for cardiac)
- **PK/PD samples**: Use PC if pharmacokinetic focus, BS if general biomarker
- **Lab panels** (e.g., "Hematology", "Chemistry Panel"): Use LB
- **Imaging for tumor**: Use MI (imaging), not TU (tumor domain is for tumor identification data)
- **Study drug administration**: Use EX (Exposure)
- **Pregnancy tests**: Use LB (Laboratory)
- **RECIST/tumor assessments**: Use MI if imaging-based, TU if clinical assessment

## Response Format

Return a JSON array where each element corresponds to an input activity:

```json
[
  {{
    "activityId": "ACT-001",
    "activityName": "Hematology",
    "category": "LABORATORY",
    "cdashDomain": "LB",
    "cdiscCode": "C78713",
    "cdiscDecode": "Complete Blood Count",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "rationale": "Hematology refers to blood cell analysis including CBC components"
  }},
  {{
    "activityId": "ACT-002",
    "activityName": "12-Lead ECG",
    "category": "ECG",
    "cdashDomain": "EG",
    "cdiscCode": "C83167",
    "cdiscDecode": "Electrocardiogram",
    "confidence": 0.98,
    "rationale": "12-Lead ECG is a standard electrocardiogram assessment"
  }}
]
```

## Critical Requirements

1. EVERY activity MUST receive a categorization - do not skip any
2. Use ONLY the domains listed above - do not invent new codes
3. Confidence threshold: Use ≥0.90 for clear mappings, 0.70-0.89 for reasonable inferences, <0.70 for uncertain
4. Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown formatting or explanations outside the JSON
