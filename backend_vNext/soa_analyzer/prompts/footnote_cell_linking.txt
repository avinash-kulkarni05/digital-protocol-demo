Analyze this SOA (Schedule of Assessments) table structure and link footnotes to specific cells.

TABLE STRUCTURE:
{table_context}

FOOTNOTES TO LINK:
{footnote_list}

TASK:
For each footnote, determine:
1. Which table cells contain this footnote marker
2. The scope of application (column_wide, row_wide, or cell_specific)
3. Which visits and activities this footnote applies to

SCOPE DETERMINATION RULES:
- "column_wide": Marker appears in a column HEADER cell → applies to ALL activities in that visit column
  Example: "Day 1a" in header → footnote "a" applies to all activities on Day 1
- "row_wide": Marker appears in an ACTIVITY LABEL cell → applies to that activity across ALL visits
  Example: "Blood drawa" → footnote "a" applies to Blood draw at every visit
- "cell_specific": Marker appears in a DATA cell → applies only to that specific activity-visit intersection
  Example: checkmark with marker "b" in row 5, col 3 → only that specific cell

CLINICAL CONTEXT FOR SCOPE:
- Visit WINDOW footnotes (e.g., "±3 days", "within 7 days") typically apply column-wide
- CONDITIONAL footnotes (e.g., "if female", "if clinically indicated") may be column-wide or cell-specific
- SPECIMEN footnotes (e.g., "12mL at V1, 6mL at V2") are usually cell-specific
- TIMING footnotes (e.g., "pre-dose", "fasting") may be activity-wide or cell-specific

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a JSON array with one object per footnote:
[
  {{
    "marker": "a",
    "scope": "column_wide",
    "linked_cells": [{{"table_id": "tbl-001", "row": 0, "col": 3}}],
    "applies_to_visits": ["Screening", "Day 1"],
    "applies_to_activities": [],
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "reasoning": "Marker found in column header, window footnote applies to entire visit"
  }},
  {{
    "marker": "b",
    "scope": "cell_specific",
    "linked_cells": [{{"table_id": "tbl-001", "row": 5, "col": 3}}],
    "applies_to_visits": ["Day 1"],
    "applies_to_activities": ["Blood chemistry"],
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "reasoning": "Marker found in single data cell, specimen-specific note"
  }}
]

CONFIDENCE SCORING:
- 0.95+: Marker clearly found in cell, scope unambiguous
- 0.80-0.94: Marker found but scope requires interpretation
- 0.60-0.79: Marker may have OCR variations or partial matches
- <0.60: Low confidence, may need human review

If a marker is found in multiple cells of different types (header AND data), analyze the pattern:
- If in header + multiple data cells in same column → column_wide
- If in activity label + multiple data cells in same row → row_wide
- If scattered pattern → cell_specific for each cell
