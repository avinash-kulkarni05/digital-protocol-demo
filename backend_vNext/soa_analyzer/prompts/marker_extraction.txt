Extract footnote markers from these SOA (Schedule of Assessments) table cell values.

CELL DATA:
{cell_data}

INSTRUCTIONS:
For each cell, identify footnote markers that indicate references to footnotes below the table.

Common footnote marker patterns in clinical trial SOA tables:
- Single lowercase letters: a, b, c, d (often superscript)
- Single uppercase letters: A, B, C, D
- Numbers: 1, 2, 3
- Symbols: *, †, ‡, §, ¶, #, **, ††
- Combinations: a,b or ab or a/b (multiple markers)
- Greek letters that may be OCR'd: α→a, β→b, γ→c
- Superscript digits: ¹→1, ²→2, ³→3

IMPORTANT CONTEXT RULES:
1. Only extract markers that are clearly footnote references, NOT part of the content
2. "Day 1a" - the "a" IS a marker (superscript after visit name)
3. "Plasma" - the "a" is NOT a marker (part of the word)
4. "C1D1*" - the "*" IS a marker (symbol after cycle/day)
5. "Screening (SCR)" - no markers, parentheses contain abbreviation
6. "X" or "✓" alone - no markers, this is a checkmark indicator
7. "Visit 1a,b" - both "a" and "b" are markers

For HEADER cells (type: "header"):
- Markers in column headers often apply to the entire column
- "Day 1a" header means marker "a" applies to all activities in that column

For ACTIVITY cells (type: "activity"):
- Markers in activity labels often apply to that activity across all visits
- "Blood drawa" means marker "a" applies to Blood draw in all visits

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a JSON array with one object per cell that has markers:
[
  {{"idx": 0, "markers": ["a"], "normalized": "Screening"}},
  {{"idx": 3, "markers": ["b", "c"], "normalized": "Cycle 1 Day 1"}}
]

- idx: The original cell index from the input
- markers: Array of extracted marker strings (normalized: lowercase, symbols preserved)
- normalized: The cell text with markers removed

Only include cells that have markers. Skip cells with no markers.
If a cell has no markers, do not include it in the output.

Normalize markers:
- Convert to lowercase (A→a, B→b)
- Preserve symbols (*, †, ‡, §)
- Handle OCR variants (α→a, ¹→1)
- Split combined markers ("a,b" → ["a", "b"], "ab" as context-dependent)
