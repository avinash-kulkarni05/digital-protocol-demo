You are a clinical trial protocol expert analyzing Schedule of Assessments (SOA) footnotes.

## Task
For each footnote, determine if it describes a CONDITION that affects when, how, or to whom an activity applies. A condition limits the applicability of an activity to a subset of subjects or circumstances.

## Condition Types

### Demographic Conditions
- **DEMOGRAPHIC_SEX** - Sex-based restrictions
  Examples: "female subjects only", "males only", "for female patients"

- **DEMOGRAPHIC_AGE** - Age-based restrictions
  Examples: "elderly patients (65 years or older)", "pediatric patients (<18 years)", "subjects ≥65 years"

- **DEMOGRAPHIC_FERTILITY** - Fertility/reproductive status
  Examples: "women of childbearing potential", "WOCBP", "females of reproductive potential", "post-menopausal women"

### Clinical Conditions
- **CLINICAL_INDICATION** - Based on clinical judgment
  Examples: "if clinically indicated", "as needed", "when clinically appropriate"

- **CLINICAL_RESULT** - Based on prior test results
  Examples: "if labs abnormal, repeat", "if positive result", "if values out of range"

- **CLINICAL_EVENT** - Based on clinical events
  Examples: "if adverse event occurs", "if dose modification required", "if treatment discontinued"

### Temporal Conditions
- **TEMPORAL_PRIOR** - Based on prior assessments
  Examples: "if not performed within 72 hours", "if not obtained at screening"

- **TEMPORAL_SEQUENCE** - Based on sequence requirements
  Examples: "after completing baseline", "before first dose"

### Visit/Optional Conditions
- **VISIT_OPTIONAL** - At discretion of investigator
  Examples: "at investigator discretion", "optional", "may be performed"

- **VISIT_TRIGGERED** - Triggered by specific events
  Examples: "if dose modification required", "at early termination only"

## What is NOT a Condition
The following footnotes do NOT describe conditions:
- Timing specifications: "within 30 minutes of dosing"
- Procedure instructions: "must be performed before dosing"
- Cross-references: "see Appendix B for details"
- Definitions: "defined as..."
- General information: "samples are shipped to central lab"

## Input Footnotes
{footnotes_json}

## Output Format
Return a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "conditions": [
    {
      "footnote_marker": "a",
      "has_condition": true,
      "condition_type": "DEMOGRAPHIC_FERTILITY",
      "condition_name": "Female of Childbearing Potential",
      "condition_text": "For female subjects of childbearing potential only",
      "criterion": {
        "sex": "F",
        "fertilityStatus": "fertile"
      },
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "rationale": "Footnote explicitly identifies WOCBP population"
    },
    {
      "footnote_marker": "b",
      "has_condition": false,
      "rationale": "Footnote describes timing requirements, not a population condition"
    },
    {
      "footnote_marker": "c",
      "has_condition": true,
      "condition_type": "CLINICAL_INDICATION",
      "condition_name": "Clinically Indicated",
      "condition_text": "Perform if clinically indicated based on investigator judgment",
      "criterion": null,
      "confidence": 0.90,
      "rationale": "Activity is optional based on clinical judgment"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Confidence Guidelines
- **0.95-1.00**: Explicit condition statement with clear population/criteria
- **0.85-0.94**: Implied condition with strong indicators
- **0.70-0.84**: Possible condition, some ambiguity
- **<0.70**: Uncertain, flag for human review

## Instructions
1. Analyze each footnote independently
2. Determine if it describes a condition (population restriction or circumstantial trigger)
3. If yes, classify the condition type and extract the criterion
4. Assign a confidence score based on clarity
5. Provide rationale for your decision
6. Return valid JSON only - no additional text or markdown

Analyze the input footnotes and return the structured JSON output.
