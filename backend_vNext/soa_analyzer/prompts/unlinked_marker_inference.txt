These footnote markers were not found in the table cells.
Based on their text content, suggest which visits/activities they likely apply to.

UNLINKED FOOTNOTES:
{unlinked}

AVAILABLE VISITS:
{visits}

AVAILABLE ACTIVITIES:
{activities}

POSSIBLE REASONS FOR UNLINKED MARKERS:
1. OCR errors - marker in table was misread (e.g., "a" read as "α" or "1")
2. Formatting loss - superscript markers lost during HTML conversion
3. Global footnotes - footnote applies to entire table (no specific marker placement)
4. Editorial footnotes - explains abbreviations or provides general context

TASK:
For each unlinked footnote, analyze its text content and suggest the most likely applicability.

ANALYSIS APPROACH:
1. Check if footnote text mentions specific visits by name
2. Check if footnote text mentions specific assessments/activities
3. Consider the footnote type (window, conditional, specimen, timing)
4. If no specific references, determine if it's a global/general note

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a JSON array with one object per unlinked footnote:
[
  {{
    "marker": "x",
    "suggested_visits": ["Day 1", "Day 8"],
    "suggested_activities": [],
    "reason": "Footnote mentions 'Day 1 and Day 8 visits'",
    "confidence": 0.70,
    "is_global": false,
    "needs_review": true
  }},
  {{
    "marker": "y",
    "suggested_visits": [],
    "suggested_activities": [],
    "reason": "Abbreviation definition - applies globally to table",
    "confidence": 0.80,
    "is_global": true,
    "needs_review": false
  }}
]

CONFIDENCE GUIDELINES:
- 0.70+: Clear reference to specific visits/activities in text
- 0.50-0.69: Reasonable inference based on clinical conventions
- <0.50: Footnote is too general to determine specific applicability

SPECIAL CASES:
- Abbreviation definitions (e.g., "SCR = Screening"): is_global=true, applies to entire table
- Protocol references (e.g., "See Section 7.2"): is_global=true, informational only
- Conditional rules without specifics: needs_review=true, suggest most likely activities

Set needs_review=true when:
- confidence < 0.70
- Multiple equally valid interpretations exist
- Footnote text is ambiguous
