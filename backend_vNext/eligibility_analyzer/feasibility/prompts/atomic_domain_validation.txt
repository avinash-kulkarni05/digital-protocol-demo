You are a clinical terminology expert validating OMOP concept domain compatibility.

## Task
For each atomic criterion with candidate OMOP mappings, determine if the domain(s) of the mapped concepts are semantically appropriate for the clinical intent of the criterion.

## Input
{atomic_domains_json}

Each entry contains:
- atomic_id: Unique identifier
- atomic_text: The criterion text
- candidate_mappings: List of potential OMOP mappings, each with:
  - mapping_id: Identifier (M0, M1, M2, etc.)
  - term: The mapped term
  - domains: List of domain_ids from OMOP concepts (e.g., "Condition", "Measurement", "Drug", "Procedure", "Observation")

## Domain Appropriateness Guidelines

1. **Demographics/Age**: Should map to Observation, Measurement, or Person - NOT Drug, Condition
   - "Age >= 18 years" should be Observation/Person, NOT "Paclitaxel adverse reaction" (Drug)
   - "Male patients" should be Person/Observation, NOT a Condition

2. **Disease/Diagnosis**: Should map to Condition
   - "NSCLC diagnosis" should be Condition, NOT Drug or Procedure
   - "Metastatic disease" should be Condition

3. **Laboratory Values**: Should map to Measurement
   - "Hemoglobin >= 9 g/dL" should be Measurement
   - "Creatinine clearance" should be Measurement

4. **Medications/Treatments**: Should map to Drug or Procedure
   - "Prior chemotherapy" could be Drug (the medication) or Procedure (the administration)
   - "Radiation therapy" should be Procedure

5. **Biomarkers**: Should map to Measurement or Observation
   - "EGFR mutation positive" should be Measurement/Observation
   - "PD-L1 expression >= 50%" should be Measurement

6. **Safety/Comorbidities**: Should map to Condition or Observation
   - "No active infections" should be Condition
   - "Pregnancy status" should be Observation

## Validation Rules

- **VALID**: The domain semantically matches the criterion's clinical intent
- **INVALID**: The domain is semantically incompatible with the criterion
  - Example: Age criterion mapped to Drug domain = INVALID
  - Example: Disease criterion mapped to Measurement domain = INVALID (unless it's a measurement of disease)

## Output Format

Return ONLY valid JSON with this exact structure:

{
  "validations": {
    "A0001": {
      "mappings": {
        "M0": {
          "is_valid": true,
          "rationale": "Age observation appropriately mapped to Observation domain"
        },
        "M1": {
          "is_valid": false,
          "rationale": "Age criterion should not map to Drug domain - semantic mismatch"
        }
      }
    },
    "A0002": {
      "mappings": {
        "M0": {
          "is_valid": true,
          "rationale": "NSCLC diagnosis correctly mapped to Condition domain"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

Process all atomics in the input. For each atomic_id, validate all its candidate mappings.
