Extract all individual eligibility criteria from this protocol section.

⚠️ **CRITICAL - VERBATIM EXTRACTION ONLY:**
- If the PDF section has 10 criteria, you MUST return exactly 10 criteria
- DO NOT summarize, paraphrase, condense, or reword ANY criterion
- DO NOT merge multiple criteria into one
- DO NOT skip any criteria for any reason
- Copy text EXACTLY as written - character by character, word by word

SECTION TEXT:
\"\"\"
{criteria_text}
\"\"\"

Return JSON with list of criteria. Each criterion should be:
{{
  "criterionNumber": "1" or "1a" or "4" etc (the numbering from protocol),
  "originalText": "full text of the criterion - EXACTLY as written, no changes",
  "sectionName": "descriptive section name if criterion has subsections (e.g., 'Subjects Without AGA', 'Subjects With AGA', or 'All Subjects')"
}}

Rules:
1. Extract EVERY numbered criterion (1., 2., 3., etc.) that represents an ACTUAL eligibility requirement - COUNT them and ensure your output matches
2. SKIP section headers, definitions, or explanatory text (e.g., "Study Intervention is defined as...", "Abbreviations:", glossary entries)
3. If a criterion has subsections (a., b., c.), keep those as part of the text
4. If criterion has BOTH "Subjects Without AGA" AND "Subjects With AGA" sections, use "Subjects Without AGA; Subjects With AGA" for sectionName
5. If criterion has only one cohort type, use that specific cohort name
6. Preserve bullet points and sub-bullets in originalText
7. **PRESERVE EXACT WORDING** - do NOT normalize, simplify, summarize, or change ANY word. Copy verbatim.
8. Each criterion must be a requirement that patients MUST/MUST NOT meet to be eligible
9. **VERIFY COUNT** - Before returning, count your extracted criteria and compare to the source. They MUST match.

      "originalText": "...",
      "sectionName": "All Subjects" or "Subjects Without AGA" or "Subjects With AGA" or "Subjects Without AGA; Subjects With AGA"
