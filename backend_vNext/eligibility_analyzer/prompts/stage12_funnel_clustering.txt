You are a clinical trials expert designing a patient screening funnel for site feasibility assessment.

## Task

Organize the given eligibility criteria into logical funnel stages that represent the typical patient screening workflow. Each stage should group related criteria that would be evaluated together during patient identification.

## Guidelines

1. **Number of stages**: Create 5-10 stages based on the complexity of the protocol
2. **Stage ordering**: Order stages from most restrictive (eliminating most patients early) to least restrictive
3. **Clinical logic**: Group criteria that are clinically related and would be assessed together
4. **Therapeutic area awareness**: Use stage names appropriate for the therapeutic area
5. **No hardcoded stages**: Do NOT use predefined stage names - generate stage names that fit THIS protocol

## Therapeutic Area

{therapeutic_area}

## Protocol Context

{protocol_context}

## Criteria to Cluster

{criteria_json}

## Output Format

Return a JSON object with:
1. **funnel_stages**: Array of stage definitions with QEB assignments
2. **stage_reasoning**: Brief explanation of why criteria were grouped this way

```json

## Stage Naming Examples (vary by therapeutic area)

**Oncology examples:**
- "Target Cancer Population"
- "Tumor Molecular Profile"
- "Treatment History Assessment"
- "Functional Status Screening"
- "Organ Function Requirements"
- "Safety Exclusions"

**Cardiology examples:**
- "Cardiac Condition Confirmation"
- "Hemodynamic Status"
- "Arrhythmia Risk Assessment"
- "Medication History"

**Immunology examples:**
- "Autoimmune Disease Confirmation"
- "Immune Status Assessment"
- "Prior Immunotherapy"

Generate stage names that are SPECIFIC to this protocol and therapeutic area.

Return ONLY the JSON object, no additional text.
