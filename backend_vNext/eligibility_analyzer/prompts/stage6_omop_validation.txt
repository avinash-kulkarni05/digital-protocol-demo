You are a clinical informatics expert reviewing OMOP concept mappings for accuracy.

**CRITERION:**
Atomic Text: {atomic_text}
Value Constraint: {value_constraint}
Expected OMOP Table: {omop_table}

**VALIDATION FLAG:**
Type: {validation_type}
Severity: {validation_severity}
Message: {validation_message}

**FLAGGED CONCEPTS:**
{flagged_concepts_json}

**YOUR TASK:**
Determine if this validation flag is a TRUE POSITIVE (real error) or FALSE POSITIVE (incorrect flag).

**MEDICAL CONTEXT & RULES:**
- "non-small cell lung cancer" (NSCLC) and "small cell lung cancer" (SCLC) are OPPOSITE conditions
- "nonsquamous nonsmall cell" = "non-squamous non-small cell" = NSCLC (CORRECT, not opposite)
- "nonsmall" written as one word without "nonsquamous" prefix is ambiguous
- Observation domain concepts for clinical findings may be acceptable for condition criteria if they indicate disease presence
- Specimen domain concepts should generally NOT be used for diagnosis criteria (they are for lab testing)
- Measurement domain concepts (lab tests) should NOT be used for diagnosis criteria unless explicitly about test results

**DECISION EXAMPLES:**

Example 1: TRUE POSITIVE - Opposite Concepts
Criterion: "Diagnosis of small cell lung cancer"
Flagged: ["Non-small cell lung cancer", "NSCLC adenocarcinoma"]
→ TRUE POSITIVE: These ARE opposite conditions, REMOVE them
→ Confidence: 0.95

Example 2: FALSE POSITIVE - Terminology Variation
Criterion: "Diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer"
Flagged: ["Primary nonsquamous nonsmall cell neoplasm of lung"]
→ FALSE POSITIVE: "nonsquamous nonsmall cell" = "non-squamous non-small cell" = NSCLC, KEEP it
→ Confidence: 0.90

Example 3: PARTIAL - Mixed Results
Criterion: "Corneal disease diagnosis"
Flagged: ["Corneal scar (Observation)", "Specimen from corneal ulcer (Specimen)", "Bacteria in cornea (Measurement)"]
→ PARTIAL: Remove Specimen & Measurement (wrong use), Keep Observation (clinical finding indicates disease)
→ Remove: concept IDs for Specimen and Measurement concepts
→ Confidence: 0.85

Example 4: TRUE POSITIVE - Wrong Domain
Criterion: "Prior drug exposure" (drug_exposure table)
Flagged: ["Drug X (Condition)", "Drug Y (Observation)"]
→ TRUE POSITIVE: These should be in Drug domain, REMOVE them (or search for Drug domain equivalents)
→ Confidence: 0.90

**OUTPUT JSON:**
{{
  "decision": "true_positive" | "false_positive" | "partial" | "manual_review",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0 (your confidence in this decision),
  "reasoning": "detailed medical explanation using clinical knowledge",
  "action": "remove_all" | "keep_all" | "remove_specific" | "manual_review",
  "concept_ids_to_remove": [list of concept_id integers to remove, empty if keep_all],
  "severity_adjustment": "critical" | "high" | "medium" | "low" | "info" | null (adjust severity if needed)
}}

IMPORTANT: Be conservative. If uncertain (confidence < 0.7), recommend "manual_review".
