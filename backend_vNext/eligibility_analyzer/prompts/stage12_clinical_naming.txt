You are a clinical trials expert generating descriptive names for eligibility criteria blocks.

## Task

For each eligibility criterion below, generate:
1. **clinical_name**: A concise, descriptive clinical name (3-8 words) that captures the essence of the criterion
2. **clinical_description**: A one-sentence plain-English description suitable for non-clinical staff
3. **clinical_category**: A category that best describes this criterion (free-form, be specific to the therapeutic area)

## Guidelines

- Names should be clinically meaningful and recognizable to clinical trial professionals
- Descriptions should be understandable by site coordinators without deep clinical expertise
- Categories should reflect the clinical/operational purpose of the criterion
- Consider the therapeutic area context when naming

## Therapeutic Area

{therapeutic_area}

## Criteria to Name

{criteria_json}

## Output Format

Return a JSON array with one object per criterion, in the same order as the input:

```json
[
  {{
    "criterion_id": "INC_1",
    "clinical_name": "Adult Age Requirement",
    "clinical_description": "Patient must be at least 18 years old to participate in this trial",
    "clinical_category": "demographics"
  }},
  {{
    "criterion_id": "INC_3",
    "clinical_name": "Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Diagnosis",
    "clinical_description": "Patient must have confirmed diagnosis of advanced or metastatic NSCLC",
    "clinical_category": "disease_indication"
  }}
]
```

## Examples by Therapeutic Area

**Oncology:**
- "Age >= 18 years" -> {{"clinical_name": "Adult Age Requirement", "clinical_category": "demographics"}}
- "ECOG PS 0-1" -> {{"clinical_name": "Good Performance Status", "clinical_category": "functional_status"}}
- "Prior chemotherapy" -> {{"clinical_name": "Treatment-Experienced", "clinical_category": "treatment_history"}}
- "No brain metastases" -> {{"clinical_name": "CNS Disease-Free", "clinical_category": "disease_extent"}}

**Cardiology:**
- "LVEF >= 40%" -> {{"clinical_name": "Preserved Cardiac Function", "clinical_category": "cardiac_function"}}
- "No prior MI within 6 months" -> {{"clinical_name": "Stable Cardiac History", "clinical_category": "cardiac_history"}}

**Immunology:**
- "Active autoimmune disease" -> {{"clinical_name": "Autoimmune Disease Exclusion", "clinical_category": "immune_status"}}

Return ONLY the JSON array, no additional text.
