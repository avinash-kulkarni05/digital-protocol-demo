Extract all individual eligibility criteria from this section.

⚠️ **CRITICAL - VERBATIM EXTRACTION ONLY:**
- If the PDF section has 10 criteria, you MUST return exactly 10 criteria
- If the PDF section has 7 criteria, you MUST return exactly 7 criteria
- DO NOT summarize, paraphrase, condense, or reword ANY criterion
- DO NOT merge multiple criteria into one
- DO NOT skip any criteria for any reason
- Copy text EXACTLY as written - character by character, word by word
- The count of criteria in your output MUST MATCH the count in the input

**SECTION TEXT:**
```
{criteria_text}
```

**Your Task:**
1. Extract EVERY numbered criterion (1., 2., 3., etc.) - COUNT them first!
   **CRITICAL**: Each criterion may span MULTIPLE LINES with indentation
   - A criterion starts with a number (e.g., "14.")
   - It continues until the NEXT numbered criterion OR the end of the section
   - Include ALL lines belonging to that criterion, even if indented
   - Example: If criterion 14 starts at "14. Subject has..." and the next line is indented "    participating in...",
     that indented line is PART OF criterion 14
   - **VERIFY**: Your output count MUST equal the input count

2. For EACH criterion, detect if it **references another section**:
   - Patterns: "as specified in Section X.X", "See Section X", "listed in Section X.X.X", "described in Section X"
   - If found, note the section number and what content is being referenced

3. If criterion has subsections (a., b., c.), keep those as part of the text

4. Detect cohort-specific criteria:
   - Look for: "Cohort A", "Subjects with AGA", "Subjects without AGA", "Arm 1", etc.
   - Note the specific cohort name in sectionName field

**Return JSON:**
{{
  "criteria": [
    {{
      "criterionNumber": "1",
      "originalText": "full text of criterion including subsections",
      "sectionName": "All Subjects" or "Cohort A" or "Subjects With AGA" etc,
      "has_cross_reference": true/false,
      "cross_reference": {{

      }} (if has_cross_reference, otherwise null)

}}

**Examples:**

Example 1 (No cross-reference):
Input: "1. Subject has histologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer"
Output:
{{
  "criterionNumber": "1",
  "originalText": "Subject has histologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer",
  "sectionName": "All Subjects",
  "has_cross_reference": false,
  "cross_reference": null
}}

Example 2 (With cross-reference):
Input: "2. Subject must not be taking prohibited medications as specified in Section 6.5.2"
Output:
{{
  "criterionNumber": "2",
  "originalText": "Subject must not be taking prohibited medications as specified in Section 6.5.2",
  "sectionName": "All Subjects",
  "has_cross_reference": true,
  "cross_reference": {{
    "target_section": "6.5.2",
    "reference_type": "prohibited medications",
    "reference_phrase": "as specified in Section 6.5.2"
  }}
}}

Example 3 (Cohort-specific):
Input: "3. Subjects With AGA: Must have documented EGFR mutation"
Output:
{{
  "criterionNumber": "3",
  "originalText": "Subjects With AGA: Must have documented EGFR mutation",
  "sectionName": "Subjects With AGA",
  "has_cross_reference": false,
  "cross_reference": null
}}

Example 4 (Multi-line criterion - CRITICAL):
Input:
```
14. Subject has voluntarily agreed to participate by giving written informed
    consent/assent for the trial. The subject may also provide consent/assent for Future
    Biomedical Research. However, the subject may participate in the main trial without
    participating in Future Biomedical Research.
```
Output:
{{
  "criterionNumber": "14",
  "originalText": "Subject has voluntarily agreed to participate by giving written informed consent/assent for the trial. The subject may also provide consent/assent for Future Biomedical Research. However, the subject may participate in the main trial without participating in Future Biomedical Research.",
  "sectionName": "All Subjects",
  "has_cross_reference": false,
  "cross_reference": null
}}
**Note**: All 4 lines are included in originalText as ONE criterion!
